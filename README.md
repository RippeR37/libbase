### Project description

The [`libbase`](https://github.com/RippeR37/libbase/) is a small library that
provides its users with a reimplementation of many useful low-level utilities
from Chromiumâ€™s
[`//base`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/base/) module as well
as other useful utilities (e.g. simplified networking stack based on `//net` )
without the need to depend on the whole (or parts of the) Chromium itself.

For more details with examples see the
[documentation](https://ripper37.github.io/libbase/).


### Building `libbase`

#### Dependencies

- [GLOG](https://github.com/google/glog)
- (Optional) [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- (Optional) [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)

Dependencies either have to be already installed and CMake has to be able to
find them with `find_package()` or they can be resolved with `vcpkg`.

It's recommended to use `vcpkg` to resolve all dependencies. To do so, make sure
to export `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable before configuring the CMake
project:

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg/root/
```

#### Building with CMake

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RippeR37/libbase.git
cd libbase
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build [-j <parallel_jobs>] [--config <Release|Debug>]
```

#### Running unit tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Using `libbase` in your project

You can add `libbase` to your project by either building and installing all
required dependencies and the library itself, or using `vcpkg` to do that for
you. It's recommended to use `vcpkg`.

#### With `vcpkg`

You can install `libbase` in _classic mode_ with:

```bash
vcpkg install ripper37-libbase
```

or (recommended) in _manifest mode_ by adding to your project's `vcpkg.json`
file this library as a dependency:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "your-project",
  // ...
  "dependencies": [
    // ...
    "ripper37-libbase"
  ]
}
```

#### Manual

Refer to the
[building section above](https://github.com/RippeR37/libbase?tab=readme-ov-file#building-libbase)
on how to build the library and dependencies. Once built, make sure to install
them with

```bash
cmake --install build [--prefix <install_path_prefix>]
```

#### Add to your CMake project

Once `libbase` is installed in your system, simply add it and link it to be able
to use it:

```cmake
find_package(libbase CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE libbase::libbase)
```

For more details please refer to the
[documentation](https://ripper37.github.io/libbase/master/getting_started/using.html)
or check out the
[CMake-based example project](https://github.com/RippeR37/libbase-example-cmake).
