Simple example
==============

Below you can find source code of a simple example that uses main features of
the ``libbase`` library. This example is located in the ``/examples/simple/``
directory in the repository and - if
:ref:`enabled <configuration-libbase-build-examples>` - will be built along the
``libbase`` library itself.
